    <p> The year is 2017. In today’s world, we have YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, Google, Twitter,
    even our own personal websites; however, the coffee shop down the street still doesn’t have a
    website. This small business, despite making the best brownies in the entire country and
    being capable of shipping them anywhere in the world, is limited by its geographical position
    on this planet. I’ve discovered many local restaurants, parks, shops, and even people who
    provide amazing services that physical location shouldn’t be able to impede upon—yet, it does.
    </p>

    <p> I won’t allow this to go on forever. I envision a world where I can discover unique
    talents, skillful artisans or delectable foods all within a few moments through the internet.
    Everyone doesn’t know how to set up a website or run a successful social media campaign. Not
    everyone needs to. Not everyone knows how to make delicious brownies, but everyone knows how to
    eat one. All you need to understand is that the brownie is delicious, and the internet is just
    like that. I don’t understand the sorcery behind creating a small pastry that virtually
    everyone on the planet can enjoy, but you know what? I don’t have to. There exist, already,
    this amazing bakery that does.
   </p>

    <p> AXSModern? We’re that savvy new bakery that has all the best pastries. You need an elegant
    webpage? Done. Want to sell merchandise or schedule appointments through that website? No
    problem. Want to share how deeply our digital brownies has changed your life the world? We know
    the best hashtags to use so you that your Inbox is “Lit.” Now, I don’t know about you, but I
    can’t bake a good brownie. What I can do is eat a brownie and determine whether it’s delicious.
    What I can do is express an idea to a baker about a pastry that I would love to eat; that
    baker? He’ll get just what I need out the oven. You don’t truly need to understand how the
    internet works for you to understand when a website looks bad or if someone’s social media page
    has organic followers. All I ask it that you communicate a dream to us, even if it’s a
    chocolate drizzled apple cobbler pie. Here at AXSModern, we’ll make that dream a reality.
